# English-Premier-League

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) I've conducted on the English Premier League dataset is quite comprehensive and informative. Here's a summary of the key insights and analyses I've performed:

Data Loading and Inspection: I loaded the dataset containing Premier League match data from 1993 to 2023 and inspected its structure using methods like .head(), .tail(), .shape, and .info().

Data Preprocessing: I renamed columns for better readability and created a new column for points based on match outcomes (win, draw).

Performance Trends of Big Six Teams: I analyzed the performance trends of the "Big Six" teams (Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham) over the years, visualizing their total points accumulation using an interactive line plot.

Teams with Most Home and Away Points: I identified the teams with the most home and away points for each season, providing insight into the home and away dominance of certain teams across different seasons.

Teams with the Least and Highest Total Points: I found the teams with the least and highest total points accumulated in each season, shedding light on both the top-performing and underperforming teams across different seasons.

Derby County's Record: I highlighted Derby County's unfortunate record of accruing the lowest points ever in a Premier League season (only 11 points), achieved during the 2007-2008 season.

Overall, my EDA effectively covers various aspects of Premier League history, team performance, and notable records, providing valuable insights for football enthusiasts and analysts.
